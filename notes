pure functions
--------------
1. Returns the same result if the same arguements are passed in
2. Depend solely on the arguements passed into them
3. Do not produce side effects such as API requests and I/O Operations 

The most important feature of pure function is that it is predictable
If we have a function that takes in our state and an action that occurred, the function should return the exact same result every single time

Reducer function
-----------------
A reducer must be a pure function. It takes in the state and the action and returns the new state for the application. 

store, reducer and action is the way that Redux works
